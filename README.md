# Walmart Sales Data Ingestion and Transformation in BigQuery using Airflow

This project demonstrates an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for ingesting and transforming Walmart sales data into Google BigQuery using Apache Airflow. The pipeline includes creating datasets and tables, loading data from Google Cloud Storage (GCS) to BigQuery, and performing an UPSERT operation using SQL MERGE.
